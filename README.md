A self driving neural network implementations on Gazebo with Tensorflow

On Gazebo a vehicle and its several environments are built

MLP, CNN, RNN, Hybrid(CNN-RNN) neural network architectures are employed for self driving task

Models attempt to control the vehicle speed, direction angle and keep the vehicle on track. 

Prediction task is approached as both classification and regression problems.

Grayscale and colorful images are used separately.

Datasets are constructed by a human driver on specific tracks. Each model is trained on those datasets.
